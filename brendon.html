            <p class="readable">
                Brendon was born in 1986 (six years into the greatest deacde) in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>.
                He was raised in the northeast, mostly in and around New England. As a kid, he moved a lot. He has lived in
                Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Jersey.
            </p>
            <p class="readable">
                Brendon never really attended high school, and first matriculated at the Community College of Rhode Island
                with the equivalent of about an eighth grade education. After several semesters as a community college student,
                he transferred to Rhode Island College in Providence, Rhode Island.
                Brendon majored in Philosophy and Mathematics and minored in Physics. He continued on at Rhode Island College
                after his B.A., earning an M.A. in Mathematics. The result of these educational choices is that he is today an
                occasionally passable philsopher, a mostly middling mathematician, and (very rarely) an insightful
                student of phyiscs <strike>(none of which has ever helped him a whit to land a decent job)</strike>.
            </p>
            <p class="readable">
                Brendon's mother raised him on her own, and he imagines it was a much more difficult thing to do
                than anything he has ever done or ever will do.
            </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="readable">
                In May of 2020, Brendon earned an M.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>,
                where he specialized in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>. Shortly thereafter, he began working 
                as a Data Specialist in the Office of Research, Planning and Accountability at Providence Public Schools. In that role, he is a SQL Developer,
                a DBA, a Sys. Admin, a Python / R Devloper, a Web Developer, a Project Manager, a Data Sceintist, and a Data Engineer, depending upon the day 
                (or the <em>time</em> of day).
            </p>
            <p class="readable">
                Brendon plays guitar, though not nearly as well as he would like (On the other hand, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hetfield"> 
                James Hetfield</a> once remarked, when it comes to music, "If you're ever satisfied, then the game's over." Hetfield is as generally correct in his
                opinions re musical matters as he is <em>incorrect</em> in his opinions re political matters.) He values imagination and creativity, and agrees
                that "Imagination is more important than knowledge", though he thinks that knowledge is really pretty darned important, too. 
            </p>
            <p class="readable"> He is the first ever recipient of the <a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/mitx/philaward-19/">MITx Philosophy Forum Award</a>.</p>
            <p class="readable">
                Brendon is happily married to <a href="kelsey.html">Kelsey Lucas</a>, and they live together on the East Side of Providence with their two 
                <a href="theboys.html">cats</a>, Archimedes and W. Me. Ow. Quine.

                Brendon is basically a Rawlsian Liberal (or a Reactionary Liberal / Bernie Bro, according to his borther-in-law), and strongly suspects that most of the advantages you and he enjoy are the result of a combination of personal good luck and having been born into an economically advanced society
                (or an economically privileged household.) He does not aspire to be rich, and he doesn't think that you should either (though he is generally
                in favor of working hard in order to increase the number of distributive shares available for equitable distribution amongst everybody, everywhere.)
