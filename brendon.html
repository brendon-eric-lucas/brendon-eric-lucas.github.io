                This is Brendon.

                <u>Early Life</u>
            </h5>
            <p>
                Brendon was born in 1986 (six years into the greatest deacde) in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>.
                He was raised in the northeast, mostly in and around New England. As a kid, he moved a lot. He has lived in
                Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Jersey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brendon never really attended high school, and first matriculated at the Community College of Rhode Island
                with the equivalent of about an eighth grade education. After several semesters as a community college student,
                he transferred to Rhode Island College in Providence, Rhode Island.
                Brendon majored in Philosophy and Mathematics and minored in Physics. He continued on at Rhode Island College
                after his B.A., earning an M.A. in Mathematics. The result of these educational choices is that he is today an
                occasionally passable philsopher, a mostly middling mathematician, and (very rarely) an insightful
                student of phyiscs (none of which has ever helped him a whit to land a decent job.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Brendon was raised by his mother alone. He imagines it was a more difficult thing to raise him
                alone than anything he has ever done or ever will do.
            </p>
            <h5>
                <u>Recent Life</u>
            </h5>
            <p>
                This past May, he earned an M.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, where he specialized
                in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brendon plays guitar (though not nearly as well as he would like), tries to write and draw as the time to do so
                becomes available, and generally values imagination and creativity (both of which he wishes he possessed in greater
                abundance.)
            </p>
            <p> He is the first ever recipient of the <a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/mitx/philaward-19/">MITx Philosophy Forum Award</a>.</p>
            <p>
                Brendon is happily married to Kelsey Lucas, and they live together on the East Side of Providence with their two cats,
                Archimedes and W. Me. Ow. Quine.

                Brendon is basically a Rawlsian Liberal, and strongly suspects that most of the advantages you and he enjoy are
                the result of a combination of personal good luck and having been born into an economically advanced society
                (or an economically privileged household.) He does not aspire to be rich, and he doesn't think that you should either (though he is generally in favor of
                working hard in order to increase the number of distributive shares available for equitable distribution amongst everybody, everywhere.)
