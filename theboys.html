                Quine is ~ six years old. Archimedes (a.k.a Archimiddles, a.k.a. Middles) is ~ five years old. Quine was the runt of his
                litter. Middles was rescued from a now defunct animal shelter in East Greenwhich, Rhode Island.

                They are technically "step brothers", Quine having been Brendon's cat and Middles having been Kelsey's. They initially lived
                apart, but became coinhabitants when Brendon moved in with Kelsey. They didn't exactly hit it off when they were first
                introduced. It took almost a whole month before they could be in the same room together.

                They are now occasional good friends! They play chase daily, and Archimedes shares all of his meals with Quine (whether he
                wants to or not.) They also sometimes share a couch, or a bed, or a window (see photo at left.)
