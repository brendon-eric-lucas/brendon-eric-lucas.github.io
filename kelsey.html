                <u>Early life</u>
            </h5>
            <p>
                Kelsey grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moraga,_California">Moraga, California</a>
                (just outside Berkeley.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Kelsey did her undergrad at <a href="https://www.reed.edu/">Reed College</a> (ever heard of it?) in Portland, Oregon where
                she studied economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2011, Kelsey graduated from Reed and entered into Teach For America, a secret organization dedicated to tricking
                high achieving graduates of mostly elite colleges and universities into spending at least two years of their lives
                working for substandard wages as public school teachers in economically disadvantaged communities within the U.S.A.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kelsey moved to Providence, Rhode Island and began teaching at the Paul Cuffee School, a public K-12 charter school
                in Providence. She earned her master's at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, one of the eight
                historic colleges and universities collectively known as the Ivy League (and widely regarded as the
                "Harvard of Rhode Island".)
            </p>
            <h5>
                <u>Recent Life</u>
            </h5>
            <p>
                Kelsey is the first ever Paul Cuffee School District Teacher of the Year, and is a gited and dedicated mathematics
                educator. She is entering her tenth year in the classroom, having been tricked <em>quite severly</em> by expertly crafted
                TFA propoganda into spending her professional life in the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kelsey is married to Brendon, which is his good luck and her bad fortune. Her decision to marry him is arguably
                the only questionable life choice she has ever made, being otherwise very circumspect and responsible when it
                comes to decision making.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Kelsey claims to be a Kantian, though it is not clear that Kant would agree with her interpretation of his views.
                Regardless, she is a very good and smart person (even though she has never read the early Wittgenstein.)
